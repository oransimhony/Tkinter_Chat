# Tkinter_Chat

An ugly chat GUI in Python 2.7.15 with Tkinter

# Usage

Run ```server.py``` and connect from ```client.py```.

You can run as many instances of ```client.py``` as you'd like.

If the server runs on another machine change the ip and port on line 27. (```server_host = ('127.0.0.1', 5000)```)

^^ The variable ```server_host``` in ```client.py```

To run the server:
```sh
python server.py
```

To run the client:
```sh
python client.py
```

Enjoy
